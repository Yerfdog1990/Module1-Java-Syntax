LocalTime class
-The LocalTime class was created for cases where you need to work with time but without a date. For example, suppose you're writing an alarm clock application. You care about the time, but not the date.
-The LocalTime class is very similar to the LocalDate class â€” its objects similarly cannot be changed after creation.
