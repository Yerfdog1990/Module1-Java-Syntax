package Two_Dimensional_Arrays;
//Smallest sum
//******************************************************************************
//The Solution class contains a two-dimensional 3x3 array of numbers (array field).
// In the main method, you need to fill this array, row by row, with data read from the keyboard,
// calculate the sum of the elements in each column and in each row, and then display the smallest
// of these sums on the screen.
//
//Requirements:
//        •	The program needs to read 9 numbers from the keyboard.
//        •	The array variable must be filled with numbers read from the keyboard.
//        •	The program needs to display the minimum sum of elements in any row or column.
